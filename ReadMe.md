# MILLENNIAL TRANSLATION SERVICE

The MTS is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that translates and defines millennial slang so that you can keep up with the young’uns.

## PREREQUISITES & INSTALLATION

The application requires a text editor with ruby functionality and the necessary gems in order to run.

The gems can be installed by running ‘bundle install’ in your terminal.

The application also requires an API key which can be generated from https://rapidapi.com/community/api/urban-dictionary.
API Key is placed within getdata.rb replacing the ```XX "X-RapidAPI-Key" => "XX"```


## USAGE

Fork and clone the repository from GitHub at https://github.com/drbarq/mod-one-project.
Open the folder in a text editor of your choice, then enter ruby config/environment.rb to initiate the translator application.
Begin by entering your name, then simply follow the directions and input the appropriate command numbers.
If you entered a word that we recognize, we will return the definition and give you the option to save it to your username.
