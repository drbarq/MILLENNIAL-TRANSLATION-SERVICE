# MILLENNIAL TRANSLATION SERVICE

The Millennial Translation Service is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that translates and defines millennial slang so that you can keep up with the youngâ€™uns.

## PREREQUISITES & INSTALLATION

The application requires a text editor with ruby functionality. Fork and clone the repository from GitHub at https://github.com/drbarq/MILLENNIAL-TRANSLATION-SERVICE. The required gems are listed in the Gemfile and can be installed by running ```bundle install``` in your terminal.

The application also requires an API key which can be generated from https://rapidapi.com/community/api/urban-dictionary.
The API Key that you generate should be placed in double quotes within getdata.rb in the @@data section, following ```X-RapidAPI-Key =>```.


## USAGE

Open the project folder in a text editor of your choice, then run ```ruby config/environment.rb``` in your terminal to initiate the translator application.
Begin by entering your name, then simply follow the directions and input the appropriate command numbers.
If you enter a word that we recognize, we will return the definition and give you the option to save it to your username.
